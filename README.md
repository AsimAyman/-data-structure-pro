# Data Structure Pro

This repository contains implementations of the Vector and Queue data structures in C++.

## Overview

This project aims to provide comprehensive implementations of fundamental data structures, specifically focusing on Vector and Queue in C++. Each data structure is organized within its respective directory, making it easy to explore and understand the implementations.

### Data Structures Included

- **Vector**
  - An array-like dynamic data structure that can resize itself automatically.
- **Queue**
  - A linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) principle.

## Implementation Details

### Vector

The vector implementation in this repository showcases a dynamic array structure with various operations and functionalities, including:

- Insertion and deletion of elements at the end and specified positions.
- Resizing and handling memory dynamically.
- Accessing elements by index and iterating through the vector.

### Queue

The queue implementation here demonstrates a FIFO structure with the following functionalities:

- Enqueuing and dequeuing elements from the front of the queue.
- Checking if the queue is empty and retrieving its size.
- Implementing a basic queue using arrays.

## Usage

### Vector

To use the vector implementation:

1. Navigate to the `C++/Vector` directory.
2. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ vector.cpp -o vector
1 Go to the C++/Queue directory.
2 Compile the code:
 ```bash
g++ queue.cpp -o queue
```

3 Include the necessary header files in your project.

4 Create objects of the data structures and use their methods/functions as needed.
